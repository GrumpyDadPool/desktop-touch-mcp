//! internal #216 — move the keyboard focus to the element ourselves, before a pattern method acts.
//!
//! The client is created with `AutoSetFocus` off (`thread.rs`), so `Invoke` and `SetValue` no longer
//! move the focus. That is what stops the fall onto GameInputSvc's window, and it is also what an
//! application reads to commit a value: with nothing moving the focus, "write a field, press Save"
//! saved the OLD value (win2, VF V1: WinForms binding OnValidation 3/3, WPF binding LostFocus 3/3).
//! So the focus is moved here, by a road that does not raise the fall.
//!
//! MEASURED win2 2026-10-03 (internal `dev/v210-dogfood`, `dev/gis216-spike/fable-c2/RESULTS-R17*.md`,
//! a plain UIA client with `AutoSetFocus` off, 111 cells), the roads below and what they did:
//! - **The element has a window of its own** (WinForms TextBox, NumericUpDown's inner edit,
//!   ComboBox, CheckBox, ListBox, Button; a Win32 dialog's Edit): `AttachThreadInput` to its thread,
//!   then Win32 `SetFocus` on that window. Closing afterwards fell 0/18 (the default client: 18/18);
//!   with the window behind, the foreground stayed on the user's window at every step (60/60) and the
//!   keys the user's window was receiving all arrived (200/200 in 15/15 cells); the value reached the
//!   application's model when the focus left the field (the step that focuses the button).
//! - **A list item, inside a list that has a window of its own**: the same, on the list's window;
//!   then the item is invoked. 0/3 falls (the default client 3/3).
//! - **WPF and Chromium** (no window of their own): UI Automation's own `SetFocus`. No fall and the
//!   value committed, but with the window behind it takes the foreground, and most keys typed
//!   meanwhile go to that window (153–183 of 200) — as the default client does there.
//! - **Except Chromium behind another window** (`"kept_behind"`): its focus is not moved. MEASURED win2
//!   2026-10-03 (`RESULTS-R22b.md`, plain UIA, a key-counting window in front receiving 200 keys):
//!   moving it took the foreground 3/3 and the front window received 23–26 keys; not moving it kept
//!   the foreground 3/3, all 200 arrived, and the page still committed (its `input` and `change`
//!   fire on the write itself, model new 3/3). WPF lost its commit the same way (a LostFocus binding
//!   saved the old value 3/3), so WPF is taken another way, below. The user's decision (2026-10-03).
//! - **WPF behind another window** (`"legacy_takefocus"`): `LegacyIAccessible.Select(SELFLAG_TAKEFOCUS)`
//!   instead of UI Automation's `SetFocus`. MEASURED win2 2026-10-03 (`RESULTS-R23b.md`, plain UIA,
//!   the same key-counting window in front): taking the focus this way into the field, writing, then
//!   taking it into Save and pressing kept the foreground, all 200 keys arrived and the LostFocus
//!   binding saved the new value, 3/3; UI Automation's `SetFocus` took the foreground (33–35 keys)
//!   and, there, still saved the old one. Taking it into Save alone did not commit — the field never
//!   had the focus — which is why the write takes it into the field first. In front, WPF keeps UI
//!   Automation's `SetFocus` (measured, R17a-2); this road was measured behind only. When the
//!   pattern is missing or refuses, a WPF element behind is left where it is (`"kept_behind"`).
//! - **Anything else is left where it is** (`"skipped"`): a Win32 or WinForms element with no window
//!   of its own (a toolbar or ToolStrip button, a tree item, a tab, a grid cell, a menu item), and
//!   every framework not measured. UI Automation's `SetFocus` is the very call that raised the fall
//!   (`thread.rs`: `SetFocus` alone, 3/3), and on those elements it would aim at the container's
//!   window, a child — the shape that falls. Leaving it is what the client did with `AutoSetFocus`
//!   off and nothing else (no fall); a value a field holds is then committed only if the press itself
//!   commits it, as for a person clicking a ToolStrip button (gate 2 on `0eccd63c`).
//! - A window that is a top-level or a popup (a dialog's own root, a combo box's drop-down list) is
//!   not given Win32 `SetFocus`, which would activate it — R17 measured child controls only.
//!
//! What this does not cover (same rounds): a Win32 menu item with a submenu still falls (menu mode,
//! not focus); and a ListBox item written with `Select` or a ComboBox written with `SetValue` never
//! reaches a WinForms bound model whichever way the focus moves (internal #238).
